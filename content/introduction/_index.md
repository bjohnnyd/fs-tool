This document is meant to be a simple guide to the technical aspects of using `fs-tool`. It is not
meant to cover the underlying idea of `fs-tool` nor why you might want to use it; for this you should
read our paper, *Debebe et al Identifying the immune interactions underlying HLA class I disease
associations* [eLife 2020; 9:e54558](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54558)

None of it will make much sense unless you have read the paper first! If you have any questions/problems/comments then
please get in touch with [Becca Asquith](mailto:b.asquith@imperial.ac.uk) or [Bisrat Debebe](mailto:johnny.debebe@nottingham.ac.uk). 
Please do not forget to cite us if you use fs-tool or the underlying ideas:
