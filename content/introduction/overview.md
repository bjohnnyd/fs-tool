`fs-tool` takes as an input a file of peptide predictions for the HLA class I alleles and proteome of
interest, performs the fraction shared calculations and generates an output file which lists the fraction
shared by the different metrics. If a cohort of subjects/genotypes is provided, comparisons can be made
between an allele of interest and the individuals.

This documentation provides details on:

 - generating the input files
 - running the tool
 - interpreting the output file 
 - integrating the output file into your cohort calculations.
