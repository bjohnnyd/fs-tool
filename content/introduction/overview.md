The fs-tool takes as an input a file of peptide predictions for the HLA class I alleles and proteome of
interest, performs the fraction shared calculations and generates an output file which lists the fraction
shared by the different metrics. Below are details about generating the input file, running the tool,
interpreting the output file and then integrating the output file into your cohort calculations.
Instructions on installation with an example are at the end.
