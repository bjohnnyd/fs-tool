DESCRIPTION


The prediction output for each molecule consists of the following columns:

Pos Residue number (starting from 0)

HLA Molecule/allele name

Peptide Amino acid sequence of the potential ligand

Core The minimal 9 amino acid binding core directly in contact with the MHC

Of The starting position of the Core within the Peptide (if > 0, the method predicts a N-terminal protrusion)

Gp Position of the deletion, if any.

Gl Length of the deletion.

Ip Position of the insertions, if any.

Il Length of the insertion.

Icore Interaction core. This is the sequence of the binding core including eventual insertions of deletions.

Identity Protein identifier, i.e. the name of the Fasta entry.

Score The raw prediction score

Aff(nM) Predicted binding affinity in nanoMolar units (if binding affinity predictions is selected).

%Rank Rank of the predicted affinity compared to a set of random natural peptides. This measure is not affected by inherent bias of certain molecules towards higher or lower mean predicted affinities. Strong binders are defined as having %rank<0.5, and weak binders with %rank<2. We advise to select candidate binders based on %Rank rather than nM Affinity

BindLevel (SB: strong binder, WB: weak binder). The peptide will be identified as a strong binder if the % Rank is below the specified threshold for the strong binders, by default 0.5%. The peptide will be identified as a weak binder if the % Rank is above the threshold of the strong binders but below the specified threshold for the weak binders, by default 2%.
NOTES
Peptide vs. iCore vs. Core
Three amino acid sequences are reported for each row of predictions:
The Peptide is the complete amino acid sequence evaluated by NetMHCpan. Peptides are the full sequences submitted as a peptide list, or the result of digestion of source proteins (Fasta submission)
The iCore is a substring of Peptide, encompassing all residues between P1 and P-omega of the MHC. For all intents and purposes, this is the minimal candidate ligand/epitope that should be considered for further validation.
The Core is always 9 amino acids long, and is a construction used for sequence aligment and identification of binding anchors.
